# Microbit devkit

A base for my micro:bit projects in C/C++ 

Code should be placed in the `/src` directory 

# Workflow

1. Get the required dependencies with the `get-dependencies.sh` script
2. Write your program
3. Run `build.sh -f <filepath>`
4. (Optional), you can run `build.sh` with the `-w` flag which auto-writes the program onto your microbit
